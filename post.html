                <p>A great way to improve your skills when learning to code is by solving coding challenges. Solving
                    different types of challenges and puzzles can help you become a better problem solver, learn the
                    intricacies of a programming language, prepare for job interviews, learn new algorithms, and more.
                    Below is a list of some popular coding challenge websites with a short description of what each one
                    offers.
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <h3>
                        <li>
                            Topcoder:
                        </li>
                    </h3>

                    <p>TopCoder is one of the original platforms for competitive programming online. It provides a list
                        of algorithmic challenges from the past that you can complete on your own directly online using
                        their code editor. Their popular Single Round Matches are offered a few times per month at a
                        specific time where you compete against others to solve challenges the fastest with the best
                        score.

                    <h3>
                        <li>
                            LeetCode:
                        </li>
                    </h3>

                    <p>LeetCode is a popular Online Judge that provides a list of 190+ challenges that can help you
                        prepare for technical job interviews. You can solve the challenges directly online in one of 9
                        programming languages. You are not able to view other users solutions, but you are provided
                        statistics for your own solutions such as how fast your code ran when compared to other users.
                        They also have a Mock Interview section that is specifically for job interview preparation, they
                        host their own coding contests, and they have a section for articles to help you better
                        understand certain problems.

                    </p>

                    <h3>
                        <li>
                            Project Euler:
                        </li>
                    </h3>

                    <p>Project Euler provides a large collection of challenges in the domain of computer science and
                        mathematics. The challenges typically involve writing a small program to figure out the solution
                        to a clever mathematical formula or equation, such as finding the sum of digits of all numbers
                        preceding each number in a series.
                        You cannot directly code on the website in an editor, so you would need to write a solution on
                        your own computer and then provide the solution on their website.

                    <p>HackerRank provides challenges for several different domains such as Algorithms, Mathematics,
                        SQL, Functional Programming, AI, and more. You can solve all the challenge directly online
                        (check out this example). They provide a discussion and leaderboard for every challenge, and
                        most challenges come with an editorial that explains more about the challenge and how to
                        approach it to come up with a solution. Aside from the editorial, you cannot currently view the
                        solutions of other users on HackerRank.
                        HackerRank also provides the ability for users to submit applications and apply to jobs by
                        solving company-sponsored coding challenges.
